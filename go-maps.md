Go Maps
Maps are used to store data values in key:value pairs.

Each element in a map is a key:value pair.

A map is an unordered and changeable collection that does not allow duplicates.

The length of a map is the number of its elements. You can find it using the len() function.

The default value of a map is nil.

Maps hold references to an underlying hash table.

Go has multiple ways for creating maps.


**Allowed Key Types**

The map key can be of any data type for which the equality operator (==) is defined. These include:

Booleans
Numbers
Strings
Arrays
Pointers
Structs
Interfaces (as long as the dynamic type supports equality)

Invalid key types are:

Slices
Maps
Functions
These types are invalid because the equality operator (==) is not defined for them.
