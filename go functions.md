**Go functions**

A function is a block of statements that can be used repeatedly in a program.

A function will not execute automatically when a page loads.

A function will be executed by a call to the function.

**Create a function**

To create (often referred to as declare) a function, do the following:

Use the func keyword.
Specify a name for the function, followed by parentheses ().
Finally, add code that defines what the function should do, inside curly braces {}.

**Call a function**

Functions are not executed immediately. They are "saved for later use", and will be executed when they are called.

In the example below, we create a function named "myMessage()". The opening curly brace ( { ) indicates the beginning of the function code, and the closing curly brace ( } ) indicates the end of the function. The function outputs "I just got executed!". To call the function, just write its name followed by two parentheses ():

**Naming Rules for Go Functions**

A function name must start with a letter
A function name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
Function names are case-sensitive
A function name cannot contain spaces
If the function name consists of multiple words, techniques introduced for multi-word variable naming can be used
